      This is essentially a hack of the most famous cookie recipe in the world, which
      we all know from the back of the Nestle “morsel” bag. Extra chewiness is
      attained by substituting bread flour for regular all purpose, replacing one egg
      white with milk, and changing the ratio of brown to white sugar.

      I don’t recommend half or double batches. Instead, make a whole batch, bake what
      you want, portion and freeze the rest.

      <p>Makes about 2 dozen cookies.</p>

      <strong>Another note:</strong>

      Keep in mind this is a “chocolate chip” cookie and therefore the
      quality of the final product will be greatly effected by the quality of the
      chips used. Although the semi-sweet “morsels” that we all know from the yellow
      bag are serviceable, I’d suggest combining such kid-friendly fodder with
      something a bit more daring, say dark chocolate chips/chunks in the 68% cocoa
      range. Oh, and remember you can chop your own.

    <p>Alton Brown is a foodie phenomenon: a great cook, a very funny guy,
      and—underneath it all—a science geek who’s as interested in the chemistry of
      cooking as he is in eating. (Well, almost.)
